		<p> I found many different ways to help build good credit in my research, some you may have heard
of and some you may not know. Building your credit score is very important for many reasons, especially when
financing things such as a home, car, RV, etc. Here are three good tips to help build your credit score:
		<ul>
			<li>Pay your bills on time!</li>
			<li>Pay off Debt and Keep Balances Low on Credit Cards and Other Revolving Credit.</li>
			<li>Do not close unused credit cards, having that account helps build credit.</li>
		</ul>
